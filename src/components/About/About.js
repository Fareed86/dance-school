            <h1 className="text-success"><u>Why Choose Dance Soul: </u>
            </h1>
            <p className="px-5 fs-6">We offer excellent dance education. We welcome both the student who works toward a professional career in dance as well as the student who dances purely for the joy of movement and the benefits that transfer to everyday life. All our teachers are highly qualified adults who have a love for dance and teaching. Our classes are structured and teach proper technique at the same time as having fun!! Our preschool classes use props and movement music to help guide the dancer as they learn.

                We are family oriented. We get it; we have kids too! We love our Shine families and truly treasure our dancers. All of our music, costumes and even dance moves are age appropriate and wholesome. Our shows are entertaining for all members of the family, even grandparents. We also offer a sibling discount for tuition.

                We LOVE our community! We believe that giving back to our community is the best way to help our next generation. Our dancers participate in parades, events, nursing home performances, Thanksgiving food drives and more!

                Our Holiday Spectacular is one of a kind! Perfect to get the whole family into the holiday spirit! Our Showcase at the end of the season is a great way to see how much your dancer has learned for the year. Our shows are held at Port Jefferson High School and run approx. 90 min long.Shine Dance Company focuses on the growth of the student in the art of dance. Although participation is not required, we believe that students should appear in these annual performances to sharpen their performance skills, an integral part of dance training. We do not, however, place a heavy emphasis on this production during class time. Class time spent rehearsing is kept to a minimum, as our teaching curriculum spans all school year.
